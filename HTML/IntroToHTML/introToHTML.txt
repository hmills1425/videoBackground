HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic structure/content (or Skeleton) of a website
1. Elements
    A. HTML is made up of different Elements (AKA Tags)
        i. Example: <h1> Hello World</h1>
    B. Elements consist of an opening and closing tag with some content in between
        i. Note: There are some exceptions to this rule (Example Self-closing elements/tags)
2. File Naming
    A. HTML file will end with ".html" extension
    B. The standard name for an HTML file is "index.html"
        i. When a browser attempts to display a website, it will first look for an index.html file  
            a. NOTE: Some websites consist of multiple HTML files. Therefore NOT every HTML file will be named index.html
